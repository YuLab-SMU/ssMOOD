## Version Mapping

The table below shows the correspondence between the **running version** (the user-facing release number) and the underlying **codebase version** (the core implementation).
This mapping helps ensure reproducibility in research and makes it easier to track which codebase was used for a specific software release.

```markdown
| Running Version | Codebase Version | Notes                |
| --------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| v1.1.0 (Now)    | v4.7.0           | Latest release       |
| v1.0.0          | v4.6.0           | First major release  |
```

* **Running Version**: the version number displayed in the software interface or release notes.
* **Codebase Version**: the internal development version of the core analysis engine.
* **Notes**: brief description of the release status.

## V1.0.0

This release introduced a series of major improvements and new features, with emphasis on performance, usability, and analytical capabilities.

* **Consistent visualization**: Chart color schemes aligned with those in the corresponding publication for result consistency.
* **Differential expression analysis**: Added sorting functionality for clearer interpretation of results.
* **Enhanced navigation**: Implemented an advanced pagination component to improve browsing efficiency within the DE and Gene Set Enrichment results.
* **Interactive legends**: Redesigned legends enabling synchronized interaction between UMAP/ST spatial plots and gene expression maps.
* **Functional enrichment**: Completed three Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses.
* **Improved user experience**: Introduced a loading screen and animated chart placeholders to avoid blank states during data processing.
* **Performance optimization**: Improved chart rendering efficiency and refined heatmap visualization for enhanced clarity.
* **Code maintenance**: Resolved multiple warning messages to ensure cleaner builds and more stable performance.
* **Dataset integration**: Finalized the dataset integration module, with spatial transcriptomics (ST) datasets displayed in separate views.
